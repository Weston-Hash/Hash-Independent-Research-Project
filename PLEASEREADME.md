# Hash-Independent-Research-Project
This is my Independent Research Project assigned by Mr. Yande. The final project file is thousands of lines long, its crazy that I, Weston Hash, wrote each and every one of them.

Once upon a time, there was a student named Alex who was enrolled in a computer science program at a prestigious university. Alex was passionate about coding and had a keen interest in developing his own independent project. He wanted to create something that could help people and make a difference in the world. After some brainstorming and research, Alex decided to create a web application that would help people track their carbon footprint. He wanted to make it easy for individuals to understand their impact on the environment and take steps to reduce their carbon footprint. Alex worked tirelessly on his project, spending countless hours researching, designing, and coding. He encountered numerous challenges and setbacks along the way, but he persevered and refused to give up. He was determined to create something truly remarkable. Finally, after months of hard work, Alex completed his project. The web application was sleek, intuitive, and easy to use. It allowed users to input their daily activities, such as transportation and energy usage, and calculate their carbon footprint. The application also provided personalized tips and recommendations on how to reduce one's carbon footprint. Alex was thrilled with his creation and couldn't wait to share it with the world. He submitted his project to the university's computer science department, where it quickly gained recognition and praise from professors and fellow students alike. Soon, Alex's web application began to gain traction outside of the university as well. People from all over the world started using it to track their carbon footprint and make positive changes in their daily lives. Alex had accomplished his goal of creating something that could help people and make a difference in the world. In the end, Alex's hard work and dedication paid off. His project not only earned him top marks in his computer science program, but it also made a lasting impact on the environment and the people who used it.
